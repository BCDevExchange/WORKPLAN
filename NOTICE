## Message from the CAO of City of Courtenay

While strategic planning is being increasingly implemented in Local Government, there is currently a disconnect between strategic planning and corporate capacity. The City of Courtenay has developed and implemented a corporate capacity program based on Open Source programming. This new program allows for the development of an annual Work Plan that is based both on Council’s strategic priorities, and the City’s statutory requirements. Each year the Work Plan is collectively developed by the senior management team, and once approved by Council, is supported by the Financial Plan.  The Work Plan resides on the City’s intranet and is directly connected to individual staff timesheets providing real time analysis and feedback to department heads and managers. In combination with monthly financial status updates, the Work Plan is the CAO’s tool for oversight of managers, reporting to Council and the public, and to establish annual performance measures for Administration and senior management.

In a time of increasing demand for “Value for Money” in Local Government, as demonstrated by the creation of an Auditor General for Local Government in 2012, estimating and tracking corporate capacity enhances the use of scarce human and financial resources, and provides greater transparency, municipal performance measurement, and reporting.
